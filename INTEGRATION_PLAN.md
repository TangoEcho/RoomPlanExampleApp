## Data Model Adapter

```swift
// CoordinateAdapter.swift
import simd
import Foundation

extension simd_float3 {
    /// Convert simd_float3 to WiFiMap's Point3D
    var toPoint3D: Point3D {
        return Point3D(x: Double(x), y: Double(y), z: Double(z))
    }
    
    /// Create from Point3D
    init(from point: Point3D) {
        self.init(Float(point.x), Float(point.y), Float(point.z))
    }
}

extension Point3D {
    /// Convert Point3D to simd_float3
    var toSimd: simd_float3 {
        return simd_float3(Float(x), Float(y), Float(z))
    }
}

// Convert WiFiMeasurement between formats
extension WiFiMeasurement {
    func withPoint3D() -> WiFiMapMeasurement {
        return WiFiMapMeasurement(
            location: location.toPoint3D,
            signalStrength: Double(signalStrength),
            frequency: WiFiFrequencyBand.from(frequency),
            floor: currentFloor ?? 0
        )
    }
}
```

## Migration Examples

### Before (Basic RF Calculation):
```swift
// WiFiSurveyManager.swift
let distance = simd_distance(location, routerPosition)
let signalStrength = -40 - (distance * 10) // Simplistic
```

### After (Advanced Propagation Model):
```swift
// WiFiSurveyManager.swift
let propagationModel = PropagationModels.ITUIndoorModel(environment: .residential)
let pathLoss = propagationModel.pathLoss(
    distance: Double(distance),
    frequency: 5200.0, // 5GHz
    floors: abs(currentFloor - routerFloor)
)
let signalStrength = transmitPower - pathLoss - wallAttenuation
```

### Before (Simple Placement):
```swift
// NetworkDeviceManager.swift
let score = item.category == .table ? 0.8 : 0.4
```

### After (Intelligent Optimization):
```swift
// NetworkDeviceManager.swift
let optimizer = PlacementOptimizer(configuration: .residential)
let recommendations = try await optimizer.optimizeExtenderPlacement(
    baselineConfiguration: currentNetwork,
    in: roomModel,
    targetCoverage: 0.95 // 95% coverage target
)
```

## Performance Settings

Since accuracy is prioritized over performance:

```swift
// PerformanceConfiguration.swift
struct AccuracyFirstConfiguration {
    static let propagationSettings = PropagationSettings(
        enableRayTracing: true,
        gridResolution: 0.25, // 25cm grid
        maxReflections: 3,
        calculateAllBands: true,
        use3DPropagation: true
    )
    
    static let optimizationSettings = OptimizationSettings(
        searchStrategy: .exhaustive,
        maxIterations: 1000,
        convergenceThreshold: 0.001,
        enableParallelProcessing: true
    )
}
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test adapter layer conversions
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify PropagationModels with known scenarios
3. **Performance Tests**: Measure computation time for typical rooms
4. **Accuracy Tests**: Compare predictions with actual measurements
5. **Multi-floor Tests**: Verify vertical propagation calculations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All WiFiMap RF models integrated and working
- [ ] Multi-floor scanning and visualization functional
- [ ] Placement recommendations show confidence scores
- [ ] Reports include accuracy metrics and multi-band analysis
- [ ] Customer view shows clear before/after comparisons
- [ ] Performance acceptable on iPhone 12 Pro and newer

## Future Optimizations (After Initial Integration)

1. **Adaptive Grid Resolution**: Adjust based on room size
2. **Caching**: Store propagation calculations
3. **Background Processing**: Offload complex calculations
4. **Simplified Preview Mode**: Fast approximate calculations for real-time
5. **Progressive Refinement**: Start with coarse grid, refine gradually

## Notes

- Keep all existing Spectrum branding and UI components
- Preserve AR visualization and haptic feedback systems
- Maintain professional floor plan rendering
- WiFiMap components should be treated as a computational backend
- User-facing features remain in the Spectrum app layer
