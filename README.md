### Technical Implementation

#### **NetworkDeviceManager Class** (272 lines)
Central coordinator for all device placement logic:

```swift
class NetworkDeviceManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var router: NetworkDevice?
    @Published var extenders: [NetworkDevice] = []
    @Published var suitableSurfaces: [SuitableSurface] = []
    @Published var isRouterPlacementMode: Bool = false
    
    // Surface suitability scoring algorithm
    private func calculateSuitabilityScore(for item: RoomAnalyzer.FurnitureItem) -> Float {
        var score: Float = 0.0
        
        // Base score by furniture type (tables preferred)
        switch item.category {
        case .table: score += 0.8
        case .sofa: score += 0.4
        default: score += 0.1
        }
        
        // Height optimization (waist-height ideal)
        let idealHeight: Float = 1.0
        let heightDifference = abs(item.position.y - idealHeight)
        let heightScore = max(0, 0.2 - heightDifference * 0.1)
        score += heightScore
        
        // Surface area consideration
        let surfaceArea = item.dimensions.x * item.dimensions.z
        let areaScore = min(0.2, surfaceArea * 0.02)
        score += areaScore
        
        // RoomPlan confidence integration
        score += item.confidence * 0.1
        
        return min(1.0, score)
    }
}
```

#### **NetworkDevice3DModels Class** (292 lines)
Realistic 3D model creation with detailed geometry:

```swift
static func createRouterModel() -> SCNNode {
    let routerNode = SCNNode()
    
    // Main body with realistic materials
    let bodyGeometry = SCNBox(width: 0.25, height: 0.05, length: 0.15, chamferRadius: 0.01)
    let bodyMaterial = SCNMaterial()
    bodyMaterial.diffuse.contents = UIColor(red: 0.15, green: 0.15, blue: 0.15, alpha: 1.0)
    bodyMaterial.metalness.contents = 0.1
    bodyMaterial.roughness.contents = 0.8
    
    // Animated LED indicator
    let ledNode = SCNNode(geometry: SCNCylinder(radius: 0.01, height: 0.005))
    ledNode.geometry?.materials = [blueLEDMaterial]
    let pulseAction = SCNAction.sequence([
        SCNAction.fadeOpacity(to: 0.3, duration: 1.0),
        SCNAction.fadeOpacity(to: 1.0, duration: 1.0)
    ])
    ledNode.runAction(SCNAction.repeatForever(pulseAction))
    
    // Dual antennas with proper positioning
    let antenna1 = createAntenna()
    antenna1.rotation = SCNVector4(0, 0, 1, Float.pi * 0.15)
    let antenna2 = createAntenna()  
    antenna2.rotation = SCNVector4(0, 0, 1, -Float.pi * 0.15)
    
    // Assembly with ventilation details
    routerNode.addChildNode(bodyNode)
    routerNode.addChildNode(ledNode)
    routerNode.addChildNode(antenna1)
    routerNode.addChildNode(antenna2)
    // ... additional detail nodes
    
    return routerNode
}
```

#### **Surface Analysis Algorithm**
Intelligent furniture evaluation for optimal extender placement:

1. **Height Constraints**: 0.5m - 2.0m range for accessibility
2. **Furniture Preference**: Tables > Counters > Sofas > Other
3. **Size Optimization**: Larger surfaces score higher for stability
4. **Confidence Integration**: Uses RoomPlan detection confidence
5. **Position Calculation**: Centers device on surface with height offset

- **Animation Performance**: 60 FPS on device, optimized for battery life
- **Memory Usage**: ~2MB additional for 3D models and textures
- **Surface Detection**: Works with any RoomPlan-detected furniture

### Key Design Decisions and Rationale

#### 1. **User-Controlled Scanning** (vs Auto-Detection)
**Decision**: Manual start/stop buttons instead of automatic completion detection
**Rationale**: RoomPlan doesn't provide reliable completion signals; user knows best when they've captured enough data
**Implementation**: `primaryActionTapped()` switches between "Start/Stop Room Scan" based on `isScanning` state

#### 2. **Distance-Based WiFi Measurements** (vs Time-Based)
**Decision**: Record measurements every 1 foot of movement instead of every second
**Rationale**: Prevents overwhelming the system with too many data points while ensuring adequate coverage
**Implementation**: `simd_distance(location, lastPosition) >= 0.3048` (1 foot in meters)

#### 3. **Architectural Symbols** (vs Generic Shapes)
**Decision**: Professional furniture symbols instead of simple rectangles
**Rationale**: Makes floor plans immediately recognizable to technicians and customers
**Implementation**: Specialized drawing methods for each furniture category with proper labels

#### 4. **AR Performance Optimization**
**Decision**: Limited nodes (20 max), 2-second update intervals, simplified AR config
**Rationale**: Prevents device overheating and maintains smooth AR tracking
**Implementation**: Node pooling with `maxNodes = 20` and `updateInterval = 2.0`

### Detailed Component APIs

#### RoomCaptureViewController
**Primary Responsibility**: UI state management and workflow coordination

**Key Properties**:
```swift
private var isScanning: Bool = false           // Current scanning state
private var capturedRoomData: CapturedRoom?    // Processed room data from RoomPlan
private var primaryActionButton: UIButton?     // Context-sensitive main action
private var speedTestProgressView: UIProgressView?  // Speed test visual feedback
```

**State Management Logic**:
```swift
func updateButtonStates() {
    if isScanning {
        primaryActionButton?.setTitle("Stop Room Scan", for: .normal)
    } else if capturedRoomData == nil {
        primaryActionButton?.setTitle("Start Room Scan", for: .normal)
    } else if !wifiSurveyManager.isRecording {
        primaryActionButton?.setTitle("Start WiFi Survey", for: .normal)
    } else {
        primaryActionButton?.setTitle("Stop WiFi Survey", for: .normal)
    }
}
```

**Critical Methods**:
- `primaryActionTapped()`: Main user interaction handler
- `startSession()`/`stopSession()`: RoomPlan capture control
- `startWiFiSurvey()`/`stopWiFiSurvey()`: WiFi measurement control
- `updateStatusLabel()`: Visual feedback with color-coded backgrounds

#### RoomAnalyzer
**Primary Responsibility**: AI-powered room classification and furniture cataloging

**Enhanced Classification Algorithm**:
```swift
func classifyRoom(surface: CapturedRoom.Surface, objects: [CapturedRoom.Object]) -> RoomType {
    // Step 1: Object-based scoring
    var kitchenScore = 0, bedroomScore = 0, bathroomScore = 0
    
    for object in nearbyObjects {
        switch object.category {
        case .refrigerator, .oven, .dishwasher: kitchenScore += 3
        case .bed: bedroomScore += 4
        case .toilet, .bathtub: bathroomScore += 4
        case .sofa, .television: livingRoomScore += 3
        // ... complete scoring logic
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Find highest scoring room type
    let maxScore = scores.max(by: { $0.1 < $1.1 })
    
    // Step 3: Fallback to size-based classification if no objects
    if maxScore?.1 == 0 {
        return classifyRoomBySize(surface: surface)
    }
    
    return maxScore?.0 ?? .unknown
}

func classifyRoomBySize(surface: CapturedRoom.Surface) -> RoomType {
    let area = calculateSurfaceArea(surface)
    let aspectRatio = max(width, depth) / min(width, depth)
    
    // Size-based heuristics
    if area < 6.0 { return aspectRatio > 2.0 ? .hallway : .bathroom }
    else if area < 12.0 { return aspectRatio > 2.0 ? .hallway : .bedroom }
    else if area < 25.0 { return .bedroom }
    else { return .livingRoom }
}
```

**Data Structures**:
```swift
struct IdentifiedRoom {
    let type: RoomType                    // Classification result
    let bounds: CapturedRoom.Surface      // Original RoomPlan data
    let center: simd_float3              // Room center point
    let area: Float                      // Calculated floor area
    let confidence: Float                // Classification confidence (0-1)
    let wallPoints: [simd_float2]        // Actual wall boundary points
    let doorways: [simd_float2]          // Door/opening positions
}
```

#### WiFiSurveyManager
**Primary Responsibility**: Network performance measurement and data collection

**Real Speed Testing Implementation**:
```swift
func performRealSpeedTest(completion: @escaping (Result<Double, SpeedTestError>) -> Void) {
    guard !isRunningSpeedTest else { return }
    isRunningSpeedTest = true
    
    // Use 1MB download for speed calculation
    let testURL = URL(string: "https://httpbin.org/bytes/1048576")!
    let startTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    
    // Progress tracking with timer
    let progressTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.2, repeats: true) { [weak self] timer in
        let elapsed = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() - startTime
        let progress = min(Float(elapsed / 10.0), 0.95)
        self?.speedTestProgressHandler?(progress, "Testing download speed...")
    }
    
    // Download task with completion handler
    let task = session.downloadTask(with: request) { tempURL, response, error in
        let duration = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() - startTime
        let bytes = Double(fileSize)
        let mbps = (bytes * 8 / duration) / 1_000_000
        completion(.success(mbps))
    }
}
```

**Distance-Based Recording**:
```swift
func recordMeasurement(at location: simd_float3, roomType: RoomType?) {
    guard isRecording else { return }
    
    // Only record if moved at least 1 foot
    if let lastPosition = lastMeasurementPosition {
        let distance = simd_distance(location, lastPosition)
        guard distance >= measurementDistanceThreshold else { return }
    }
    
    lastMeasurementPosition = location
    // Create and store measurement...
}
```

#### ARVisualizationManager
**Primary Responsibility**: 3D AR visualization with performance optimization

**Node Pooling System**:
```swift
private var nodePool: [SCNNode] = []
private let maxNodes = 20

func addWiFiMeasurementVisualization(at position: simd_float3, measurement: WiFiMeasurement) {
    // Performance optimization: Limit number of nodes
    if measurementDisplayNodes.count >= maxNodes {
        let oldestNode = measurementDisplayNodes.removeFirst()
        oldestNode.removeFromParentNode()
        nodePool.append(oldestNode)  // Return to pool for reuse
    }
    
    let node = getOrCreateMeasurementNode(for: measurement)
    // ... add to scene
}
```

**Room Outline Preservation**:
```swift
func createRoomOutlines(from capturedRoom: CapturedRoom) {
    // Create semi-transparent wall outlines
    for wall in capturedRoom.walls {
        let wallNode = createWallOutlineNode(from: wall)
        // Thin white boxes showing wall positions
        wallNode.geometry = SCNBox(width: wall.dimensions.x, height: wall.dimensions.y, length: 0.02)
        wallNode.material.transparency = 0.7
    }
}
```

#### FloorPlanViewController
**Primary Responsibility**: 2D architectural floor plan rendering

**Architectural Drawing System**:
```swift
func drawArchitecturalDoor(context: CGContext, at center: CGPoint, scale: CGFloat) {
    let doorWidth: CGFloat = 12 * scale / 50
    
    // Door frame (opening in wall)
    context.setStrokeColor(UIColor.white.cgColor)
    context.move(to: CGPoint(x: center.x - doorWidth/2, y: center.y))
    context.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: center.x + doorWidth/2, y: center.y))
    context.strokePath()
    
    // Door swing arc (architectural convention)
    context.addArc(center: CGPoint(x: center.x - doorWidth/2, y: center.y),
                   radius: doorWidth, startAngle: 0, endAngle: .pi/2, clockwise: false)
    context.strokePath()
    
    // Door panel position
    context.move(to: CGPoint(x: center.x - doorWidth/2, y: center.y))
    context.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: center.x - doorWidth/2, y: center.y - doorWidth))
    context.strokePath()
}
```

**Furniture Symbol Library**:
Each furniture type has a specialized drawing method following architectural conventions:

```swift
func drawBed(context: CGContext, at center: CGPoint, size: CGSize) {
    // Bed frame outline
    context.addRect(rect)
    context.strokePath()
    
    // Pillows at head of bed (20% of length)
    let pillowRect = CGRect(x: rect.minX + 2, y: rect.minY + 2, 
                           width: rect.width - 4, height: rect.height * 0.2)
    context.setFillColor(UIColor.lightGray.cgColor)
    context.addRect(pillowRect)
    context.fillPath()
    
    drawFurnitureLabel(context: context, text: "BED", at: center)
}

func drawSofa(context: CGContext, at center: CGPoint, size: CGSize) {
    // Rounded rectangle for sofa body
    context.addRoundedRect(in: rect, cornerWidth: 4, cornerHeight: 4)
    context.drawPath(using: .fillStroke)
    
    // Dashed lines for cushion divisions
    context.setLineDash(phase: 0, lengths: [3, 2])
    let cushionWidth = size.width / 3
    for i in 1..<3 {
        let x = rect.minX + CGFloat(i) * cushionWidth
        context.move(to: CGPoint(x: x, y: rect.minY + 2))
        context.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: x, y: rect.maxY - 2))
    }
    context.strokePath()
}
```

### Performance Monitoring and Optimization

#### Memory Management Strategy
- **Node Pooling**: Reuse AR nodes instead of constant creation/destruction
- **Limited Node Count**: Maximum 20 AR measurement nodes at any time
- **Weak References**: All closures use `[weak self]` to prevent retain cycles
- **Cleanup Methods**: Explicit removal of AR nodes and timers

#### AR Performance Optimization
```swift
// Simplified AR configuration for better performance
let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
configuration.sceneReconstruction = .mesh        // Remove classification
configuration.environmentTexturing = .none       // Disable texturing
// Disable person segmentation for performance
```

#### WiFi Testing Optimization
- **Background Threading**: Network requests don't block UI
- **Progress Callbacks**: Real-time feedback prevents user confusion
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when network tests fail
- **Throttled Measurements**: Distance-based instead of time-based

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. RoomPlan Capture Failures**
- **Symptom**: `captureView(didPresent:error:)` called with error
- **Cause**: Poor lighting, insufficient LiDAR data, or device movement too fast
- **Solution**: Status messages guide user to move slower and ensure good lighting

**2. AR Tracking Performance Issues**
- **Symptom**: "poor slam" messages in console, AR nodes jumping
- **Cause**: Device overheating, insufficient processing power
- **Solution**: Reduced AR complexity, node pooling, update throttling

**3. WiFi Speed Test Failures**
- **Symptom**: `SpeedTestError` in completion handler
- **Cause**: Network connectivity issues, server unavailable
- **Solution**: Graceful fallback to last known speed, user notification

**4. Room Classification Inaccuracy**
- **Symptom**: Wrong room types detected
- **Cause**: Insufficient or ambiguous furniture objects
- **Solution**: Fallback to size-based classification with confidence metrics

#### Debug Logging Strategy
```swift
// Comprehensive logging with emoji prefixes for easy filtering
print("🏠 Classifying room with \(nearbyObjects.count) nearby objects")
print("📍 WiFi measurement #\(measurements.count) recorded")
print("🎯 Adding AR visualization for measurement")
print("⚠️ Invalid coverage value: \(coverage) at position \(position)")
```

## 🔧 Development Guide and Troubleshooting

### Build Configuration Requirements

#### Xcode Settings
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 17.0 or later
- **Frameworks**: RoomPlan, ARKit, SceneKit, Network, Core Graphics
- **Entitlements**: Camera usage, WiFi access
- **Device**: iPhone/iPad with LiDAR sensor (iPhone 12 Pro or later, iPad Pro 2020 or later)

#### Info.plist Required Keys
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your camera to use the LiDAR scanner for room mapping and WiFi analysis.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location access is needed to identify WiFi networks accurately.</string>
```

### Common Development Issues and Solutions

#### Build Issues

**Problem**: `SpectrumBranding.swift` not found during build
**Solution**: Ensure file is added to target in project.pbxproj:
```
/* SpectrumBranding.swift in Sources */ = {isa = PBXBuildFile; fileRef = [UUID] /* SpectrumBranding.swift */; };
```

**Problem**: NWPath ambiguity error
**Solution**: Use explicit Network framework import:
```swift
import Network
// Use Network.NWPath instead of just NWPath
```

**Problem**: RoomPlan availability warnings
**Solution**: Wrap RoomPlan usage in availability checks:
```swift
if #available(iOS 17.0, *) {
    roomAnalyzer.analyzeCapturedRoom(processedResult)
}
```

**Problem**: `CapturedRoom.Confidence` type conversion errors
**Solution**: RoomPlan's Confidence is an enum (.high, .medium, .low), not a Float:
```swift
private func confidenceToFloat(_ confidence: CapturedRoom.Confidence) -> Float {
    switch confidence {
    case .high: return 0.9
    case .medium: return 0.6  
    case .low: return 0.3
    }
}
```

#### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: App crashes on launch with NSUnknownKeyException (Fixed)
**Root Cause**: Broken storyboard outlet connections to non-existent properties
**Error**: `'[<RoomCaptureViewController> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key cancelButton'`
**Solution**: Remove broken outlet connections in Main.storyboard:
```xml
<!-- Remove these broken connections -->
<outlet property="cancelButton" destination="6LV-FR-JQF" id="oID-mD-Z4l"/>
<outlet property="doneButton" destination="MQz-pc-UhC" id="5nF-0P-w1J"/>
```

**Problem**: App crashes on simulator (Legacy Issue - Now Fixed)
**Root Cause**: ARKit and LiDAR not available on simulator
**Solution**: App now includes comprehensive simulator support with mock data:
```swift
#if targetEnvironment(simulator)
print("🎭 Running in simulator - bypassing RoomPlan compatibility check")
#else
if !RoomCaptureSession.isSupported {
    showUnsupportedDeviceAlert()
}
#endif
```

**Problem**: Not sure when scanning is "complete"
**Root Cause**: No automatic completion detection in RoomPlan
**Solution**: User decides completion based on their needs - app shows "Ready for Results" when data is available

**Problem**: WiFi measurements not appearing in AR
**Root Cause**: AR session not starting properly
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check `arVisualizationManager.isARActive` is true
2. Verify `switchToARMode()` calls `startARSession()`
3. Look for AR permission errors in console

**Problem**: Floor plan shows no walls, only furniture
**Root Cause**: Wall extraction failing from RoomPlan data
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check `room.wallPoints.count` in logs
2. Verify `extractWallPoints()` finds nearby walls
3. Fallback to rectangular room shape if no walls detected

#### Performance Issues

**Problem**: App becomes unresponsive during WiFi survey
**Root Cause**: Too many AR nodes or measurements
**Solution**: Verify node pooling is working:
```swift
// Check current node count doesn't exceed limit
if measurementDisplayNodes.count >= maxNodes {
    // Remove oldest nodes
}
```

**Problem**: Device overheating during extended use
**Root Cause**: Intensive AR processing
**Solution**: Reduce AR complexity:
```swift
configuration.sceneReconstruction = .mesh  // Not .meshWithClassification
configuration.environmentTexturing = .none
```

**Problem**: Speed tests timing out
**Root Cause**: Network connectivity or server issues
**Debug Steps**:
1. Test with known good network connection
2. Check `speedTestProgressHandler` is being called
3. Verify URL `https://httpbin.org/bytes/1048576` is accessible

### Code Modification Guidelines

#### Adding New Furniture Types
1. Add case to `CapturedRoom.Object.Category` (if not already present)
2. Update scoring in `RoomAnalyzer.classifyRoom()`:
```swift
case .newFurnitureType:
    appropriateRoomScore += scoreValue
```
3. Create drawing method in `FloorPlanViewController`:
```swift
func drawNewFurniture(context: CGContext, at center: CGPoint, size: CGSize) {
    // Follow architectural symbol conventions
    // Include appropriate text label
}
```
4. Add case to `drawArchitecturalFurniture()` switch statement

#### Adding New Room Types
1. Add case to `RoomType` enum:
```swift
case newRoomType = "New Room Type"
```
2. Update classification scoring in `classifyRoom()`
3. Add color in `roomTypeColor()` method
4. Update size-based fallback logic if appropriate

#### Modifying WiFi Measurement Frequency
Current: Every 1 foot of movement (`0.3048` meters)
```swift
private let measurementDistanceThreshold: Float = 0.3048
```
To change frequency, modify this constant:
- More frequent: `0.1524` (6 inches)
- Less frequent: `0.6096` (2 feet)

#### Customizing AR Performance
Node limit (currently 20):
```swift
private let maxNodes = 20
```
Update frequency (currently 2 seconds):
```swift
private let updateInterval: TimeInterval = 2.0
```
